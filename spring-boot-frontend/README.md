# Awesome Spring Boot Frontend

This template relies on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
to serve a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) backed UI,
including [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) support.

development framework.
Thanks to [Spring Boot Devtools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools),

CSS/HTML files without having to restart the app.
